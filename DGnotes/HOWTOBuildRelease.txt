HOWTOBuildRelease.txt

This file documents the DansGuardian release process.

1. Add the feature/fix the bug to your local source code.
2. Test that it works.
3. Update the ChangeLog file contents with details of the change and new version number.
4. Update the configure.ac file with the new version number.
5. Commit the changes to the SourceForge SVN.
6. Building the actual tarball:

As root on a modern Linux with build tools and subversion installed do:

rm -fr e2guardian (if you have a e2guardian directory)
svn co https://e2guardian.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/e2guardian/trunk e2guardian
cd e2guardian/e2guardian
./tarballup.sh

7. Eventually a tarball called e2guardian-VERSION.tar.gz will be created in the current
directory

8. Test build the tarball contents.  Ideally test run it too!

9. Emailed the tarball off to the e2guardian.org website maintainer along with text for
a news item.

10. When the file is uploaded and the news item live, you should email the DansGuardian
and DansGuardian-Announce mailing lists.

11. Await feedback on the mailing list.  Rinse and repeat.
